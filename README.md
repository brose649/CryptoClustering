# CryptoClustering
This repository showcases what we learned for the Unsupervised Learning Module

This notebook compares price changes of cryptocurrencies using K-means on scaled and PCA data.

The goal was to see whether clustered data is more accurate between the two. I found that the original scaled data had more concise clustering, and would use this over PCA to make price predictions for cryptocurrencies.
